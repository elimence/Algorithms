Linear Search
=============
In computer science, linear search or sequencial search is a method for finding a  particular value in a list, that consist of checking every one of its elements, one at a time and in sequence, untill the desired one is found.

Linear search is the simplest search algorithm; it is a special case of the brute force sarch.

 Brute Force
 -----------
  1. first (P): generate a first candidate solution for P.
  2. next (P, c): generate the next candidate for P after the current one c.
  3. valid (P, c): check whether candidate c is a solution for P.
  4. output (P, c): use the solution c of P as appropriate to the application.

  ```javascript
  c <= first(P)
  while' c \neq Î› do
   if' valid(P,c) then output(P, c)
   c <= next(P,c)
  end while
  ```+
