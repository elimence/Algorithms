# Analysis Of Algorithms

* Efficienty of an algorithm can be measured in terms of:
  	* Execution time `(time complexity)`
  	* The amount fo memory required `(space complexity)`

 * The measure which is most important depends on the limitations of the technology available at time of analysis


## Time Complexity
 
* For most algorithms analyzed here, time complexity comparisons are more interesting than space complexity comparisons.
* Time complexity: A measure of the amount of time required to execute an algorithm

* Factors that `should not` affect time complexity analysis:
	* The programming language chosen to implement the algorithm
	* The quality of the compiler
	* The speed of the computer on which the algorithm is to be executed

* Objectives of time complexity analysis:
	* To determine the feasibility of an algorithm by estimating an `upper bound` on the amount of work performed
	* To compare different algorithms before deciding on which one to implement
